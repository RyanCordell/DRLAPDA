# DRLAPDA
The PDA for the DoomRL Arsenal mod

## Structure
### acs/
While not present, this is where the compiled bytecode is output to.

### graphics/
Normally assets/, this is to help modern ZDoom-based ports read graphics data.

### source/
Can be named anything, only stores the necessary project files.

## Technologies used
### GDCC-ACC
A compiler that can take (extended-)ACS code and output bytecode that ZDoom can then read.

### ASEPRITE
Pixel art focused program which was used to produce a fair few of the graphics

### Photoshop
Creative program which was used to help align and prototype layouts

### Visual Studio Code
Used to work on the new database interpreter for the PDA
