# Bugs
* Weapon demon artifacts page has wrong scrolling speed set up for weapon mods
* Armor pages have missing icons and text
* Whitelist huds that can display the weapon name scroller
* Assemblies keep being forgotten

# Yes. (couldn't think of a category)
* Remove button bounding checks for assemblies when undiscovered

# Would be nice
* Removing armor database, rely solely on language
* Re-introduce keyboard based navigation
* Weapon icon in mods screen
* Extra buttons on first weapons page that leads to Demonic Artifacts and Mod Effects, instead of just relying on the numbered tabs above
* Wider tab buttons would be nice


# Should be fixed

# Already done
* Hide assembly tooltip if assembly is not discovered
* ADD A FUCKING NO-MOUSELOOK WARNING TO THE PDA
* Set numbered tabs into highlight mode when on the appropriate page
