# Bugs
* Weapon demon artifacts page has wrong scrolling speed set up for weapon mods
* Assemblies keep being forgotten
* Whitelist huds that can display the weapon name scroller

# Would be nice
* Removing armor database, rely solely on language
* Hide assembly tooltip if assembly is not discovered

# Already done
* ADD A FUCKING NO-MOUSELOOK WARNING TO THE PDA
* Set numbered tabs into highlight mode when on the appropriate page
