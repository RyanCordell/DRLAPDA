# TODO list

* Go through all code and clean up any unsavory comments
* Better explanation for weapon description height formula and what it's about
* Figure out JSON-based interpreter for armors, weapons, assemblies, etc.
* Go through all weapons and write down basic stats 
  > Only some basic tier weapons have such stats so far
